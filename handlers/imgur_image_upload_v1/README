=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the REST Imgur API to upload a file to your Imgur account. 
    Before using any Imgur handler for the first time, you will need to obtain 
    a refresh token to connect to the account (Instructions for that can
    be found below). After doing that, the handler will connect to that account
    and then upload the image. Title, Description, and the Album are all
    optional attributes.

== How to retrieve the Imgur Refresh Token
    After downloading this handler, run the helper webpage in the 
    handler/resources directory and follow the instructions on the page to
    generate the refresh token.
